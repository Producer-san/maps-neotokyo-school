====================

Neotokyo map. Working name.

Taken from the old file that was keeping track of changes that were made.

Recent changes:

-Raised the Skybox to make a reconjump from the fire-ladder possible without banging one's head
-Added the lower floor windows again (You keep forgetting to synchronize them!)
-The cafetaria wall (The one with the glasspanels) was misplaced, it now is properly placed
-The road with the white and yellow truck was bumpy, replaced it with a flat proper block
-Stretched the textures on the building next to the road to make it look less off and proper looking
-Moved the spawns that were in the ground level up to the second level
-The room above the ladder was formed into one single room instead of two small ones
-The spotlights are now applied for all lanterns
-Moved attacker spawns away from the entrance to prevent immidiate encounters
-Added a decal in the center of the wall when going up the first stairways.
-Replaced the door on the fireladder with one that has a proper size made from brushwork.
